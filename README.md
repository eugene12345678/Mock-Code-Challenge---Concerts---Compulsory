- **Manage Venues:** Add, update, and retrieve details about concert venues.
- **Manage Concerts:** Add concerts, link bands and venues, and check concert details.
- **Queries:**
  - Retrieve all concerts for a specific band.
  - Find all venues where a band has performed.
  - Check if a concert is a "hometown show."
  - Get all introductions for a band's concerts.
  - Find the band with the most performances.
  - Retrieve concerts for a specific venue.
  - Get bands that have performed at a venue.
  - Find the most frequent band at a venue.
  - Retrieve details of a concertâ€™s band and venue.

## Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- SQLite3

### Installation
1. **Clone the Repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/eugene12345678/Mock-Code-Challenge---Concerts---Compulsory.git
```
2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**

```bash
cd Mock-Code-Challenge-Concerts-Compulsory
```
3 **Create the SQLite Database**

Ensure you have a `concerts.db` SQLite database file. If it doesn't exist, create it by running the provided SQL commands:

```sql
-- Create the bands table
CREATE TABLE bands (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    name TEXT NOT NULL,
    hometown TEXT NOT NULL
);

-- Create the venues table
CREATE TABLE venues (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    title TEXT NOT NULL,
    city TEXT NOT NULL
);

-- Create the concerts table
CREATE TABLE concerts (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    band_id INTEGER,
    venue_id INTEGER,
    date TEXT,
    FOREIGN KEY (band_id) REFERENCES bands(id),
    FOREIGN KEY (venue_id) REFERENCES venues(id)
);
```
4. **Install Required Packages**

If you need to install any additional Python packages, you can use:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
Commit: Added example usage script to demonstrate functionality
1. **Run the Example Script**

To see how the system works, you can run the provided example usage script:
```bash
python3 main.py
```
This script demonstrates various functionalities such as adding concerts, retrieving band details, and checking venue information.
2. **Interact with the Classes**

You can import and use the classes in your Python scripts:
```python
from band import Band
from concert import Concert
from venue import Venue

# Example usage:
band = Band(id=1, name='Cybersecurities', hometown='Kenya')
concerts = band.get_concerts()
print(concerts)
```
